# Colors

More's coming.

But for now: *Colors* is a library of 1x1 PNGs, available at [http://colors.awesometm.com](colors.awesometm.com). It's an asset server, of sorts.

### FAQs

#### How do I use Colors?

Just tell your CSS file to use our URL. Like this:

		div.column{background:url(http://colors.awesometm.com/444444.png) 0 0 repeat-y; float:left; margin 10px; padding: 0 10px;}

In the above example, we pointed at 444444.png, but you can actually use any of the following syntaxes:

    http://colors.awesometm.com/333333
    http://colors.awesometm.com/333333.png
    http://colors.awesometm.com/333
    http://colors.awesometm.com/333.png

You've probably figured this out, but the value you use is the hexadecimal code for the color you want.
